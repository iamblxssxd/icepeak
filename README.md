IC3PEAK is a Russian experimental electronic duo formed by Anastasia Kreslina and Nikolay Kostilev which largely focuses on social commentary on modern life in Russia.
Their music criticizes the police state and certain values the country
holds. Playing their music on the radio is illegal in Russia.

For this project, I wanted to create a unique user experience and showcase the duo's remarkable visual style. Rather than creating a stunning layout with a lot of interactivity, I wanted to come up with something that would highlight Nick and Nastya's unique personalities. It's achieved with a very simple yet powerful layout and user interactions that play a supporting role. With this approach, the most prominent elements are not overshadowed by the less prominent ones, allowing them to shine. I have taken a lot of inspiration from the Scandinavian design style in this work. This design also reflects a great deal of influences from the Soviet era brutalism, which is in keeping with the philosophy of minimalism and simplicity serving the purpose of functionality and also is in harmony with the aesthetic that the duo has adopted for expressing their political views and ideas.
